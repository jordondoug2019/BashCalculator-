# BashCalculator
The calculator will take two integer inputs from the user and then ask the user which operation they would like to perform. Based on the user's choice, the script will perform the corresponding operation and display the result to the user. 

Requirements:

The script should prompt the user to enter two integers.
The script should prompt the user to choose an operation: +,-,*,/
Use conditionals ('if`, `elif`, `else') to perform the chosen operation.
Display the result of the operation.
Handle division by zero with an appropriate error message.
